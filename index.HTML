<section class="description" id="Facts About Ted">
    <h1>Facts About Ted</h1>
    Ted was originally named Pocus while his brother was named Hocus...
     just like Hocus Pocus! When we adopted him, we named him Teddy because he resembled a teddy bear,
      however he eventually started being called Ted as we discovered he was a bit of a terror, and Ted the Terror seemed fitting.
       His favorite snack seems to be leaves he steals from our (non-toxic!) plants inside our home. His hobbies consist of ankle biting, 
       sleeping, and harassing his older brother.

<section class="description" id="Why">
    <h1>Why</h1>
    Why did I make a page dedicated to Ted? Well Ted is a silly little guy with a big attitude.
    His stories are entertaining and he's cute, which makes him perfect for his very own website.
