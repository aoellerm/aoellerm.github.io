    <h1>Facts About Ted</h1>
        <div class="child-div">

    <h3>Ted was originally named Pocus while his brother was named Hocus...
     just like Hocus Pocus! When we adopted him, we named him Teddy because he resembled a teddy bear,
     however he eventually started being called Ted as we discovered he was a bit of a terror, and Ted the Terror seemed fitting.
     His favorite snack seems to be leaves he steals from our (non-toxic!) plants inside our home. His hobbies consist of ankle biting, 
    sleeping, and harassing his older brother when he gets the chance.

<div class="container1" id="Why">
    <h1>Why</h1>
    <h2>Why did I make a page dedicated to Ted? Well, Ted is a silly little guy with a big attitude. 
        His stories are entertaining, and he's cute, which makes him perfect for his very own website.

<div class="container2" id="Daily Life">
    <h1>Daily Life</h1>
    <div class="child-div">
        <h3>The daily life of Ted consists of being an absolute menace. He likes to wake up around 6 am, even on the weekends,
             and won't rest until everyone is awake. After that, he insists on barking loudly and running rampant with his toys; however, 
             once he gets bored with toys, he likes to bite people because he's still a puppy in training. After being chaotic, he eventually takes his afternoon nap, 
            where he becomes very snuggly and sweet. Afterwards he's back to his usual routine until late in the night
             because he's somehow an early morning and late-night type of dude.
